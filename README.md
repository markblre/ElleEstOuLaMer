## 💡 About  
This project was born from a personal challenge: to design and publish an iOS app in one week during my vacation.  
The goal was to develop my skills, deepen my mastery of Swift and SwiftUI, and show what I can achieve from start to finish.

A simple but complete project that allowed me to learn, experiment... and publish an app on the App Store!
